## [0.6.0]

### Added

 - Rough initial type annotations to `torii.hdl.mem`
 - Added the ability to specify `tar` for the `torii.build.run.BuildPlan.archive` call.
 - Added check inside `Record`s to ensure they're properly constructed prior to accessing their fields.
 - Added the ability to override a Value's operators.
 - Added the ability to put non-signals into `write_vcd`'s `traces` parameter.
 - Added name disambiguation for traced signals where they share the same name.
 - Added `ValueLike` and `ShapeLike`, mainly for additional typing and instance checking assistance.
 - Added the ability for `Cat` and `Slice`, statements to be cast as a `Const` value.
 - Added `#!/bin/sh` to the top of build shell scripts.
 - Added `BuildPlan.extract` to extract files from the build plan without having to run it, this replaces the functionality that occurred when `BuildPlan.execute_local` was passed with `run_script = False`.
 - Added `BuildPlan.execute_docker` to allow for invoking a build inside a specified docker container.
 - Added `log2_ceil` and `log2_exact` to replace `log2_int` with the `False` and `True` params respectively.
 - `ShapeCastable` objects can now be const initialized.

### Changed

 - Improved Oscillator frequency diagnostics for `torii.vendor.GowinPlatform`.
 - Fixed `torii.lib.fifo` FIFOs to use the new memory semantics correctly.
 - `torii.lib.soc.csr` Multiplexer shadow registers have been re-designed.
 - Bumped minimum Python version from 3.9 to 3.10.
 - Renamed `IntelPlatform` to `AlteraPlatform`.

 - Bumped the minimum version of Yosys to 0.30.
 - Empty `Case` blocks now throw an exception when being used in place of a `Default` block
 - Behavioral change warning in empty `Value.matches()` where currently it returns `Const(1)` but will return `Const(0)` in the future.
 - We now only close a VCD or GTKW file in the simulator if it was opened by the simulator.
 - Build shell scripts will now be marked as executable on unix-like hosts.
 - `Instance` objects know collect source location information.
 - Memories have been turned into a first-class IR representation.
 - Out-of-range rests now error, not just warn.
 - A warning is now generated when a `Case()` falls after a `Default()`, and an error is raised when there are multiple `Default()`'s in a `Switch`
 - Shape casting a `range(1)` now resolves to an `unsigned(0)`

### Deprecated

 - Deprecated `torii.vendor.intel` and `torii.vendor.intel.IntelPlatform` in favor of `torii.vendor.altera` and `torii.vendor.altera.AlteraPlatform`.
 - Deprecated `execute_local()`'s `run_script` param in favor of `extract`

 - Fixed using 0-width `Switch`'s with integer keys.
 - Trying to use the Python `in` operator on a `Value` now raises a sensible error.
 - When indexing or slicing a Value with another Value, it now raises an error and suggests to use `Value.bit_select` or `Value.word_select` instead.
 - Fixed simulation look when process catches an injected exception.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

 - Deprecated `Repl` in favor of `Value.replicate`.

### Removed

 - Removed the `torii.cli` module
 - Removed the `remote-build` category from the `setup.py` `extra_requires` due to removal of remote builds.
### Fixed

## [0.4.5]

### Added

 - Added `-norom` and `-proc` options to verilog generation if available in Yosys.
 - Added [a small tutorial](https://torii.shmdn.link/tutorials/external_modules.html) on using `platform.add_file` with `Instance` for referencing external modules.

### Changed

 - Updated the minimum Yosys version to `0.15`.

 - Invocations of `read_ilang` in Yosys scripts has been replaced with `read_rtlil` as `read_ilang` has been deprecated for a while now.
 - Replaced `sim_case` in `ToriiTestCase` with `ToriiTestCase.simulation` and added two attributes for defining the simulation domain `ToriiTestCase.comb_domain` and `ToriiTestCase.sync_domain`, the latter of which takes a `domain = ` param to specify which synchronous domain it is using.
 - The default platform in `ToriiTestCase` has been replaced with `None`, rather than `MockPlatform`
 - Gated the initialization of the `ToriiTestCase` `dut` behind a check to prevent non-simulating tests, and tests that don't use the DUT from exploding.
 - Made the `connectors` property on `Platform`'s optional, it now currently defaults to an empty list.
