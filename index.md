# Torii-HDL

```{warning}
   This manual is a work in progress and is seriously incomplete!
```

Torii is a toolkit for developing hardware based on digital logic, it consists of theã€€[Torii <abbr title="Hardware Definition Language">HDL</abbr>](./language/index.md), the [standard library](./library/index.md), the simulator, and the build system. It covers all steps of the typical <abbr title="Field Programmable Gate Array">FPGA</abbr> development workflow while not restricting the choice of tools, allowing existing [Verilog], [SystemVerilog], and [VHDL] code to be integrated into the design, while also allow for Torii to be seamlessly integrated into the flow for other [Verilog] design flows.


For more information on Torii, see the [Introduction](./intro.md) and check out the [Getting Started](./getting_started.md) guide for how to get up and running with Torii.


There is also a [collection of board definition files](https://shrine-maiden-heavy-industries.github.io/torii-boards/) for popular FPGA development boards from various vendors, to help you get up to speed with your designs faster.
