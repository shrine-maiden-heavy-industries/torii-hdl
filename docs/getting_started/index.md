# Getting Started

There are two Getting Started guides, one for [people new to HDLs] and one for [those who have prior HDL expectance].

The ones for people just getting started with HDLs will go over a lot more of the basics, such as how to navigate and use a trace/waveform viewer. Where as the one for experienced users will only go over Torii-specific differences to other HDLs and assume background knowledge.

Once you've read one (or both) of the guides, you can check out the [language guide] for a more technical reference of Torii.
