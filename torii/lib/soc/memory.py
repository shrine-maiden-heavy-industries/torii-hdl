class MemoryMap:
	'''
	Memory map.

	A memory map is a hierarchical description of an address space, describing the structure of
	address decoders of peripherals as well as bus bridges. It is built by adding resources
	(range allocations for registers, memory, etc) and windows (range allocations for bus bridges),
	and can be queried later to determine the address of any given resource from a specific
	vantage point in the design.

	Address assignment
	------------------

	To simplify address assignment, each memory map has an implicit next address, starting at 0.
	If a resource or a window is added without specifying an address explicitly, the implicit next
	address is used. In any case, the implicit next address is set to the address immediately
	following the newly added resource or window.

	Parameters
	----------
	addr_width : int
		Address width.
	data_width : int
		Data width.
	alignment : log2 of int
		Range alignment. Each added resource and window will be placed at an address that is
		a multiple of ``2 ** alignment``, and its size will be rounded up to be a multiple of
		``2 ** alignment``.
	name : str
		Name of the address range. Optional.

		A window is a device on a bus that provides access to a different bus, i.e. a bus bridge.

		Sparse addressing
		-----------------

		If a narrow bus is bridged to a wide bus, the bridge can perform *sparse* or *dense*

		one transaction on the narrow bus; high data bits on the wide bus are ignored, and any

		Arguments
		---------
		window : :class:`MemoryMap`
			A memory map describing the layout of the window. It is frozen as a side-effect of

		sparse : bool or None
			Address translation type. Ignored if the datapath widths of both memory maps are
			equal; must be specified otherwise.
