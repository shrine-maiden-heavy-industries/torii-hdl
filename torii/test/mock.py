class MockRecord(Record):
	'''
	Mock Torii Record

	This class is a modified version of :py:class:`Record`
	that dynamically allocates a record for every field
	requested by name, and caches it.

	This allows :py:class:`MockPlatform` to return an object
	of :py:class:`MockRecord` from ``request`` and have it
	always be "correct".

	This is done by shimming the ``__getitem__`` call and when
	the field lookup fails to allocate a new record with the
	requested name and return that.

	..warning:: This only returns a record with 1-wide ``o`` and ``i`` fields

	'''

		Construct mocked Record

		When the call to ``__getitem__`` runs into a field that
		we have not mocked before, and the field is a str, then
		we insert a mocked record with an ``i`` and ``o`` field
		into the parent records fields.

		..warning:: The field widths are currently set at 1

		Parameters
		----------
		item : str
			The requested field to mock

		Return record field

		If the field doesn't exist, we create it with a call

		Parameters

		item : Any
			The name of the requested field
